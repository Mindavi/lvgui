# "`lvgui`"

This is a pre-configured project used to provide a pre-configured and common
environment to run on the Linux framebuffer, and as a "simulator", using the
"monitor" SDL options.

This is expected to be used as a library with mruby bindings.


## Acknowledgements

This is originally based on [lv_port_linux_frame_buffer](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_port_linux_frame_buffer),
but not much from the original setup remains.
